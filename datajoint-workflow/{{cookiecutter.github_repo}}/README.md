_A DataJoint SciOps Workflow for {{cookiecutter.organization}}, {{cookiecutter.lab}}_

## Description

TODO: finish description. 

Welcome to the [_modality type_] SciOps service!

This service is designed for a user to upload their raw [_modality type_] data acquired with [_description_], which will then be automatically processed with [_..._]. The service also provides online Jupyter notebooks to visualize the results.

This [workflow](https://github.com/{{cookiecutter.github_user}}/{{cookiecutter.github_repo}}) uses components from open-source packages, including the DataJoint Elements: 

- element and url
- element and url

Please follow the steps listed below to begin working with the platform.


## Using the SciOps Services

### Account Setup

1. Create a free account at [accounts.datajoint.io](https://accounts.datajoint.io/signup)

2. Create a free GitHub account at [github.com](https://github.com/signup)

!!! attention
    Please email us at [support@datajoint.com](mailto:support@datajoint.com) after you create these accounts so we can ensure your service is configured properly.

Thank you for using the DataJoint SciOps cloud-based platform.

## Installation

!!! note
    The following is intended for developers and is not required for users of the SciOps services. 

### 1. Clone the repository

First, clone a local copy of the [project repository](https://github.com/{{cookiecutter.github_user}}/{{cookiecutter.github_repo}}) and change to the location of that directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/{{cookiecutter.github_user}}/{{cookiecutter.github_repo}}.git
cd "{{cookiecutter.__project_name}}"
```

### 2. Create a new python environment

We recommend creating an isolated [virtual environment](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/) to avoid any conflicts with your existing Python packages or interpreter. You can create a virtual environment by first installing [`conda`/`mamba`](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge):

1. Create an environment using the packages listed in `environment.yml`:

```bash
mamba env create -f environment.yml --force
```

2. Activate the new environment:

```bash
conda activate {{cookiecutter.__pkg_import_name}}
```

### 3. Install the package `{{cookiecutter.__project_name}}`

After the new virtual environment has been created and activated, install this python package using `pip>=62.0` (`pip` is already in the list of requirements from the `environment.yml` file).

To avoid installing other additional packages, use the following command (see [_contrib_](./CONTRIBUTING.md#setting-up-a-local-development-environment) for extra installing packages):

```bash
pip install .
```

If you need to uninstall the package, do so with `pip`:

```bash
pip uninstall {{cookiecutter.__project_name}}
```

#### Additional setup for local development and testing

See the [_Development setup_](./CONTRIBUTING.md#setting-up-a-local-development-environment) documentation for information on how to install additional packages and tools for local development and testing environments.
